# Moon Mission Using Power Bi
Welcome to the README file for the Moon Mission Dashboard, created to visualize and analyze data related to historic moon landings. This dashboard provides valuable insights into various aspects of moon missions, mission types and mission outcomes. Below, you'll find a description of each column in the dataset and key performance indicators (KPIs) visualized on this dashboard.
# Column Descriptions
1.Mission: The name of the moon mission.
2.Launch Date: The date of the Aircraft launching.
3.Carrier Rocket: The names of the Rocket Used.
4.Spacecraft: The name of the spacecraft used for the mission.
5.Outcome: The outcome of the moon mission (e.g., successful,Launch failure , etc.).
6.Operator: The name of the organization with the name of there country.
7.Mission Tyoe: The types of the mission means for what rocket is been used. 
8.Additional Information:Tells some more information about the spacecraft like achivements.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. Total Missions: The total number of moon missions in the dataset.
2. Mission Outcomes: The number of moon landings that been successful, failure, etc.
3. Mission Types: The type of moon missions or purpose of moon mission.
4. Launch Date: The date of the mission.
5. Country: Moon Mission Launched by which country.
6. Number of Launches: It shows the number of spacecraft launched in which year or in which period of year.
7. Best Carrier Rockets: It shows the best 5 carrier Rockets has been used in that period of year

# Trends Visualization
1. Yearly Trend for Missions: Visualize the trend in the number of moon missions on a yearly basis.
2. Outcome Distribution: Display the distribution of mission outcomes (successful, aborted, etc.) across all missions.
   
# Getting Started
To start using the Moon Mission Dashboard:

1.Ensure you have a compatible tool for data analysis (e.g., Microsoft Power BI).
Open the Moon Mission Dashboard file associated with this dataset.
2.Explore the visualizations by filtering data, clicking on visual elements, and gaining insights into historic moon missions.

# Data Source

The dataset used for this dashboard is provided as "Data Set Part 1-moonlanding.csv." It contains valuable information about various moon missions and has been processed and transformed for analysis within the dashboard.
